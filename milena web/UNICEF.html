    <p>General Assembly established UNICEF to further institutionalize post-war relief work. In 1950, its mandate was extended 
        to address the long-term needs of children and women, particularly in developing countries. In 1953, the organization 
        became a permanent part of the United Nations System, and its name was subsequently changed to its current form, though 
        it retains the original acronym. UNICEF relies entirely on voluntary contributions from governments and private donors. 

        The board is made up of government representatives elected by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, usually 
        for three-year terms. UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being 
        of children. Most of its work is in the field, with a network that includes 150 country offices, headquarters and other 
        facilities, and 34 «national committees» that carry out its mission through programs developed with host governments. 
        </p>
        <p>UNICEF relies on country offices to help carry out its work through a unique program of cooperation developed with 
            the host government. Overall management and administration of the organization take place at its headquarters in 
            New York City.
            Its work is coordinated by the bureau, comprising the president and four vice-presidents, each officer representing 
            one of the five regional groups. </p>

                <p>In 2003, UNICEF sponsored Italian football club Piacenza Calcio 1919 until 2008.
                    On 7 September 2006, an agreement between UNICEF and the Spanish Catalan association football club FC Barcelona was 
                    reached whereby the club would donate €1.5 million per year to the organization for five years. As part of the agreement
                    , FC Barcelona would wear the UNICEF logo on the front of their uniforms in yellow . This was the first time a football 
                    club sponsored an organization rather than the other way around. In January 2007 UNICEF struck a partnership with Canada's 
                    national tent pegging team. The team was officially re-flagged as «UNICEF Team Canada», and its riders wear UNICEF's logo 
                    in competition, and team members promote and raise funds for UNICEF's campaign against childhood HIV-AIDS. When the team 
                    became the 2008 tent pegging world champions, UNICEF's flag was raised alongside the Canadian flag at the games, the first
                     time in the history of international Grand Prix equestrian competition that a non-state flag has flown over the medal podium.
                    In Botswana, UNICEF has funded the development of new state-of-the-art HIV/AIDS education for every schoolchild in Botswana
                     from nonprofit organization TeachAids.
                    UNICEF announced a landmark partnership with Scottish club Rangers F.C. UNICEF partnered with the Rangers Charity Foundation 
                    and pledged to raise £300,000 by 2011.
                    In 2010, UNICEF created a partnership with Phi Iota Alpha, making them the first Greek Lettered Organization UNICEF has
                     ever worked with. </p>

 <b><p>WHAT DO THEY DO</p></b>
<p>UNICEF works in the world’s toughest places to reach the most disadvantaged children and adolescents, and to protect 
    the rights of every child everywhere. Across more than 190 countries, they do whatever it takes to help children survive.</p>
<b><p>HISTORY</p></b>
<p>The needs of infants received greater attention in 1959, when the United Nations adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child.
     However, "twenty years later, such 'rights,' especially those relating to nutrition, health and material well-being, were far from 
     being realized for many 
    children. Governmental, civil, religious and charitable groups around the world were quick to react in search of solutions</p>
    <b><p>WHAT DOES THE LOGO STAND FOR</p></b>
<p>UNICEF’s first logo features a child drinking a cup of milk , which reflects the organization's main activity at the time: delivering 
    milk to children. In the 1960s, ‘a child drinking milk’ is redesigned as ‘a mother lifting up a child’.
     In 2016, ‘for every child’ is adopted as the organization’s brand strategy and becomes part of the logo.</p>

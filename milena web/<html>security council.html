<p><b>What is the security council</b></p>

    <p>The United Nations Security Council is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations and is charged with ensuring international peace and 
        security, recommending the admission of new UN members to the General Assembly, and approving any changes to the UN Charter. Like the UN as a whole,
         the Security Council was created after World War II to address the failings of the League of Nations in maintaining world peace. With the collapse 
         of the Soviet Union, UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale, with the Security Council authorizing major military and peacekeeping
          missions in Kuwait, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Permanent members 
          can veto any substantive resolution, including those on the admission of new member states to the United Nations or nominees for the office of 
          Secretary-General, but there is no veto right in emergency special sessions of the General Assembly. 

        The other ten members are elected on a regional basis for a term of two years. The body's presidency rotates monthly among its members. Resolutions 
        of the Security Council are typically enforced by UN peacekeepers, which consist of military forces voluntarily provided by member states and funded
         independently of the main UN budget.

    <p><b>How do they meet</b></p>
    <p>The Security council meets every month to vote for a new president, but now that there is the COVID-19 things may
    have gotten more complicated for them to meet.
    Right now they are trying to figure out if it will be possible to meet face-to-face, because it's easier to negotiate
    that way. But unfortunately they are meeting via Teleconference.</p>
    
    <p><b>Powers and Functions</b></p>
    <p>-To maintain international peace and security in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations.</p>
    <p>-To investigate any dispute or situation which might lead to international conflict or condemnation.</p>
    <p>-To recommend methods to disputes or the terms of settlement</p>
    <p>-To recommend what actions should be taken when peace is threatened</p>
    <p>-To take military actions against aggressors</p>
    <p>-To recommend the admission of new members</p>
    <p>-To apply economic sanctions and other measures</p>
    
    
    
    <p><b>The voting system</b></p>
    
    <p>The Security Council meets every month to vote for a new president. To become a president they need to have at least 9 
    votes from other members. There are 5 permanent members of the security council with certain different powers. These are 
    Russia, France, China, USA and the UK.</p>
    
    <p><b>The permanent members and veto</b></p>
    The main reason they are the permanent members is because they were the first countries to join this organization. 
    They also have the power of veto.A veto is a power that the 5 permanent members of the council have. Itâ€™s the right to say no to a country or a resolution that was voted or elected.
    Even if the majority of the permanent members want that resolution or country and one doesn't they are still gonna veto it.

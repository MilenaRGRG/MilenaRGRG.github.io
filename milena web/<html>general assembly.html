<b><p>UNICEF</p></b>
<p>General Assembly established UNICEF to further institutionalize post-war relief work. In 1950, its mandate was extended 
    to address the long-term needs of children and women, particularly in developing countries. In 1953, the organization 
    became a permanent part of the United Nations System, and its name was subsequently changed to its current form, though 
    it retains the original acronym. UNICEF relies entirely on voluntary contributions from governments and private donors. 

    The board is made up of government representatives elected by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, usually 
    for three-year terms. UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being 
    of children. Most of its work is in the field, with a network that includes 150 country offices, headquarters and other 
    facilities, and 34 «national committees» that carry out its mission through programs developed with host governments. 
    </p>
    <p>UNICEF relies on country offices to help carry out its work through a unique program of cooperation developed with 
        the host government. Overall management and administration of the organization take place at its headquarters in 
        New York City.
        Its work is coordinated by the bureau, comprising the president and four vice-presidents, each officer representing 
        one of the five regional groups. </p>

                    protect and ensure legal rights that individuals and groups enjoy under domestic and international law. This includes programming based on the principles of 
                    equality and non-discrimination, participation and inclusion, and accountability and the rule of law.
                    By drawing on its expertise in crime prevention and criminal justice as well as in drug prevention, treatment and care, UNODC contributes to enhancing the 
                    enjoyment of human rights and addresses challenging human rights situations through risk mitigation. </p>

                <b><p>UNEP</p></b>
                <p>Since its inception in 1972, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been the global authority that sets the environmental agenda, 
                    promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system and serves as 
                    an authoritative advocate for the global environment.</p>
                    <p>UNEP’s mission is to provide leadership and encourage partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling 
                        nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.</p>
                        <p>UNEP supports Member States to ensure that environmental sustainability is reflected in development and investment planning and 
                            provides countries with the necessary tools and technologies to protect and restore the environment.

                         <p>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) was established in 1964 as an intergovernmental organization intended to 
                         promote the interests of developing states in world trade. UNCTAD is the part of the United Nations Secretariat dealing with trade, investment,
                         and development issues.  The organization`s goals are to: "maximize the trade, investment and development opportunities of developing countries and 
                         assist them in their efforts to integrate into the world economy on an equitable basis".  The primary objective of UNCTAD is to formulate policies 
                         relating to all aspects of development including trade, aid, transport, finance and technology. 
                         It was argued in UNCTAD that to promote exports of manufactured goods from developing countries, it would be necessary to offer special tariff concessions 
                         to such exports.  The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was established to provide a forum where the developing countries could discuss the 
                         problems relating to their economic development.  It is a member of the United Nations Development Group. There are non-governmental organizations 
                         participating in the activities of UNCTAD.

 <p> <b>ORIGIN</b></p>
<p>The International Sanitary Conferences , the first of which was held on 23 June 1851, were a series of conferences that took 
    place until 1938, about 87 years. With the etiology, even the communicability, of many epidemic diseases still uncertain and
    a matter of scientific argument, international agreement on appropriate measures was difficult to reach. Seven of these 
    international conferences, spanning 41 years, were convened before any resulted in a multi-state international agreement.
    Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included 
    discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid.

    In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau , and the Office International 
    d'Hygi√®ne Publique were soon founded.</p>

    <p><b>OBJECTIVE</b></p>
    <p>The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution: To act as the directing and 
        coordinating authority on international health work; To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the 
        United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations

        appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments; 
        To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups,
        such as the peoples of trust territories; To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may 
        be required, including epidemiological and statistical services; to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic,
        endemic and other diseases;To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention
        of accidental injuries; To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement

<p><b>WHO'S PRESIDENT</b></p>
<p>Tedros Adhanom was born on March 3, 1965 in Asmara. He studied Biology at the University of Asmara and after graduating in 1986 he went to work 
at the CAMP Ministry of Health. In 2001 he was appointed as Director of the Tigray Health Bureau and in 2003 as Deputy Minister of Health. In 2005 
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi appointed him as Minister of Health.</p> 
<img class="president" src="foto/Whopresident.jpeg"/>
<p>2011 he received the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Award for his contributions to improving public health in his country. It was highlighted that during 
his management, health coverage was expanded, with an increase in personnel and greater infrastructure, which made it possible to reduce the number of 
deaths from malaria and HIV. In 2016, the government of Hailemariam Desalegne proposed him as a candidate to lead the World Health Organization, with 
the endorsement of the African Union. 8 His candidacy caused controversy because it was the proposal of a government with accusations of authoritarian
practices and for the accusation in particular of Adhanom of hiding cholera epidemics during his tenure as Minister of Health.</p> 
    
<p>However, Adhanom rejected the accusation and had support for "having transformed the health system of his country.Likewise, various Ethiopian 
parties rejected Tedros Adhanom's candidacy due to his career in the Tigray People's Liberation Front, of Marxist ideology. The TPLF provided millions 
of dollars in financial support for Tedros's candidacy at the WHO. In early 2020, he oversaw the global handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2020, 
Tedros met with Chinese leaders, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi and PRC President Xi Jinping on the pandemic.</p> 
    
<p> On January 23, 2020, a WHO emergency committee decided not to declare a public health emergency of international concern. 16 In the first week of February 
2020, Tedros stated that there was no need for the world to take measures that "unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade", such as worldwide
travel restrictions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some public health experts accused Tedros of being slow to stop the epidemic and having too close a relationship 
with the Chinese government. 19 Even so, he maintains relevant contacts in the United States, specifically with Bill and Melinda Gates and with the Aspen Institute</p> 
and the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
